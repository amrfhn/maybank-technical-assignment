## Intro

First of all, I would like to say thank you for the opportunity and invited me for the technical review. I really appreciate it.

Please review the code by following the step starting from  **Getting Started**.

To be honest, from my past experience, I've never used the Google Place Autocomplete API, but when I read the instructions, I think it's worth a try. And yes, I learned new things!

I didn't use Redux Saga, Redux Thunk, Redux Promise, or Redux-Observable Epics in the development, because I hadn't used them in past projects. Less than 3 days to learn about them, it's pretty hard for me. If there is a chance, I would love to learn about them with your team at Maybank (if I pass the test).. 

Again, thank you for the opportunity.

Best Regards,
Amir

## Getting Started

First, run npm install:
```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You'll need to add your Google Key in .env.local to make the API work.
